# Resume Website

The working version of this project can be found <a href="https://www.marco-ross.com/">here</a>.

Originally this project was meant to simply display the findings of my thesis, but I decided to also make it my personal website, with part of the website being the thesis results visualized.
<br/>

The website was built using ReactJS alongside CSS, no Bootstrap. I opted to write my own CSS rather than Bootstrap the project (aside from the existing React Bootstrap components) because I wanted to learn certain CSS properties the hard way, such as how to ensure the application is mobile friendly on a variety of devices.

The website is deployed and hosted on Google Firebase. Again, I did this simply because I wanted to learn how to deploy a site, and possibly in the future a mobile app, to Firebase. It's pretty easy, check it out! <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/deploying">Firebase</a>

The React components used in this project can be found at the following:

For the "Work Experience/Education" section I used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-vertical-timeline-component">react-vertical-timeline</a>
<br/>
For the "Thesis" portion I used <a href="https://uber.github.io/react-vis/">react-vis</a>
<br/>
For the Bottom Navigation Bar I used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core">material-ui</a>
