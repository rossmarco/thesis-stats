# thesis-stats

The working version of this project can be found  <a href="https://www.marco-ross.com/">here</a>.

Originally this project was meant to simply display the findings of my thesis, but I decided to also make it my personal website, with part of the website being the Thesis results visualized.
<br/>
The thesis portion of the website is not deployed yet as the results of my thesis are currently in the process of being published.


The website was built using ReactJS alongside vanilla CSS, no Bootstrap. I opted to write my own CSS rather than Bootstrap the project (aside from the existing React Bootstrap components) because I wanted to learn certain CSS properties the hard way, such as how to ensure the application is mobile friendly on a variety of devices.
 
The React components used in this project can be found at the following:

For the "Work Experience/Education" section I used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-vertical-timeline-component">react-vertical-timeline</a>
<br/>
For the "Thesis" portion I used <a href="https://uber.github.io/react-vis/">react-vis</a>
<br/>
For the Bottom Navigation Bar I used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core">material-ui</a>
